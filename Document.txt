2 - ask the user to complete ILL- , here the robot will speak to the user 'ILL' and expecting the user to type 'INI'
3 - here the robot will expect the user to select the number 20 
4 - the robot will ask the user to select both boxes at first, then uncheck the bottom one 
5 - What do you like about the campus (answer doesnt matter, just a question to throw meme or not)
6 - ask the user to enter his/her name for a raffle for a bag of chosen cookie.
